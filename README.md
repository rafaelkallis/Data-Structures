# Data Structure Library for C++

These Structures have various algorithmic and database related appliances.

##### Structures Included:

* [Stack](https://github.com/rafaelkallis/Data-Structures/blob/master/README.md#stack)
* [Queue](https://github.com/rafaelkallis/Data-Structures/blob/master/README.md#queue)
* Heap
* PriorityQueue
* Tree (BST)
* TreeMap (BST Dictionary)
* [ArrayList, ArrayList-Ext](https://github.com/rafaelkallis/Data-Structures/blob/master/README.md#arraylist) (Similar to Java's ArrayList, uses amortized dynamic memory allocation based on size)
* Nodes and Containers used in different data structures

***

## Stack

A `Stack` is a basic LIFO based data structured, useful in many appliances such as Topological Sort, Undo/Redo operations, Virtual machines (e.g JVM).

`Stack` is found in `adt.h` and respective member functions in `adt.cpp`

###### Constructor:

```C++
Stack<Type> *myStack=new Stack<Type>();
```

###### Public Functions:

```C++
void Push(Type *Data);
```
```C++
myStack->Push(new int(3));
```
Inserts Data into the Stack.
***
```C++
Type* Top();
```
```C++
int *Temp=Stack->Top()
```
Returns the Last Inserted Data without removing it from the Stack.
***
```C++
void Pop();
```
```C++
myStack->Pop();
```
Removes the Last Inserted Data from the Stack.

***
```C++
int Size();
```
```C++
int Temp=myStack->Size();
```
Returns the total number of elements inside the Stack.

## Queue
 
A `Queue` is a basic FIFO based data structured, useful in many appliances such as Web Server response management, or a Process Queue for the CPU.

`Queue` is found in `adt.h` and member functions in `adr.cpp`

###### Constructor:

```C++
Queue<Type> *myQueue=new Queue<Type>();
```

###### Public Functions:

```C++
void Push(Type *Data);
```
```C++
myQueue->Push(new int(3))
```
Inserts Data into the Queue.
***
```C++
Type* Top();
```
```C++
int *Temp=myQueue->Top();
```
Returns the First Inserted Data without removing it from the Stack.
***
```C++
void Pop();
```
```C++
myQueue->Pop();
```
Removes the First Inserted Data from the Stack.
***
```C++
int Size();
```
```C++
int Temp=myQueue->Size()
```
Returns the total number of elements inside the Stack.

## ArrayList

The `ArrayList` is a dynamic memory (de)allocating Array based structure, useful in many appliances such as Heaps and any other Database which needs Constant Insertion and Retrieval Complexity. 

`ArrayList` is found in `arrays.h` and member functions in `arrays.cpp`

The Array Expands when it's filled up. It grows by a 1.5 factor, which close to the Golden Ration (Ï† = 1.61803398.. ) as it's proven to be very efficient and the Java API ArrayList also uses the same factor.

`ArrayList_Ext` is a derived `ArrayList` class which provides extended functions. Collapses when its used capacity is 45% of the available capacity. I have chosen this factor as after private research I concluded it's efficient enough. (Minimises repeatedly shrinking and growing of array so it keeps the amortised costs as low as possible).

For more info, there is a [Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array).

###### Constructor:
```C++
ArrayList<Type> *myArrayList=new ArrayList<Type>();
ArrayList_Ext<Type> *myArrayList=new ArrayList_Ext<Type>();
```
###### Public Functions:
```C++
void Insert(Type *Data);
``` 
```C++
myArrayList->Insert(new int(3));
```
Inserts Data into the ArrayList.
***
```C++
Type* Get(int index);
``` 
```C++
int *Temp=myArrayList->Get(1);
```
Returns the Data inside position of index. If index is not valid it throws an OutofBoundsException.
***
```C++
void Set(int index,Type *Data);
```
```C++
myArrayList->Set(1,new int(2));
```
Changes the Data of position index with the new Data provided.
***
```C++
void Reset();
```
```C++
myArrayList->Reset();
```
Deletes All Data inside the ArrayList and Initialises it in its original capacity (2).
***
```C++
int Size();
```
```C++
int Temp=myStack->Size();
```
Returns the total number of occupied positions inside the ArrayList.
***
##### Only in `ArrayList_Ext`
```C++
void RemoveLast();
```
```C++
myArrayList_Ext->RemoveLast();
```
Deletes the last occupied position's Data. Useful for Heaps and Priority Queues.
***
```C++
int Find(Type *Data);
```
```C++
int Temp=myArrayList_Ext->Find(new char'R');
```
Performs Linear Search and returns index of Object's position.
***
```C++
void ShrinkToFit();
```
```C++
myArrayList_Ext->ShrinkToFit();
```
Shrinks Array to last occupied space.
